## Camera Firmware

### Firmware Update Instructions

The camera firmware can be updated over USB using the following procedure:

1. Hold down the Scroll Wheel while pressing the Power Button to power up the camera in Firmware Update mode. Continue to hold down the Scroll Wheel until the Record LED flashes slowly.
2. Plug in the USB cable. The camera will appear as a USB drive. **This drive is separate from the one where clips are stored, so your footage wonâ€™t be visible but is safe and not affected by the firmware update.**
3. Drag the new firmware file \(WAVE.BIN\) into the fw folder.
4. Click the Scroll Wheel. The Record LED will begin to flash quickly as the firmware is updated.
5. Wait for the camera to automatically restart with the new firmware. This should take at most 30 seconds.

### Release Notes

#### **v1.0.1 \(27 January, 2021\)**

* Improved compensation for Shutter Line Artifact. This sensor artifact shows up as a dark row across the frame when one frame's exposure starts while the previous frame is still being read out, and is most severe in underexposed conditions. This firmware synchronizes exposure start to an exact row and, together with the latest Wave Player version, uses that information to better compensate for the artifact.
* Fixed a bug that could, in rare cases, cause image corruption after switching between 4K and 2K mode that would persist until the next power cycle. Momentary HDMI preview glitches during the 4K/2K mode switch are normal as the pipeline is reconfigured.
