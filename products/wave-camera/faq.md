# FAQ

## What resolutions and frame rates are supported?

The maximum frame rate in 4K \(17:9\) is **422fps** and in 2K \(17:9\) is **1462fps**. 2K uses subsampling, which preserves the crop factor of the Image Sensor but does not increase its light sensitivity. Other aspect ratios \(from 4:3 to 16:1\) are available with different maximum frame rates up to **9259fps** \(2048 x 128\). See [Maximum Frame Rates](maximum-frame-rates.md) for more details.

## What does "continuous recording" mean?

Wave records continuously to its internal SSD at all frame rates. This means it operates like a normal video camera: press the Record Button once to start recording and again to stop. The clip is immediately saved in non-volatile memory. There is no RAM buffer or trigger setup required. All recording is non-volatile \(power-down safe\).

## What types of lenses are supported?

Wave uses a passive, locking E-mount. **There is no electrical connection to the lens, so lenses with electronic focus or iris control are not supported.** Likewise, there is no autofocus. Wave is intended for use with manual lenses that cover a S35 sensor.

Thanks to its short flange focal distance, E-mount can be readily adapted to almost any other mount. The stock E-mount can be removed and other mount options may be added in the future. RED DSMC mounts are also supported with an optional spacer. See [Lens Recommendations](lens-recommendations.md) for a list of some good lens options for Wave.

## Does it have an on-board LCD?

No, an external HDMI monitor capable of receiving a 1080p30 signal is required to view the preview image and interact with camera menus. On-camera monitors typically also have useful tools such as histograms, waveforms, and focus assist. See [Monitor Recommendations](monitor-recommendations.md) for a list of some good monitor options for Wave.

Foregoing an on-board LCD allows the entire back surface of the camera to be used for heat sinking, which is important for high-speed capture. Embedded LCDs also tend to be lower-resolution and/or brightness than readily available on-camera monitors.

## Can the SSD be replaced or upgraded?

Yes. The internal SSD is a standard M.2 NVMe SSD that can be replaced or upgraded. Only a small number of SSDs have been tested to meet the write speed requirements of Wave right now. But by using a standard interface, the camera can be upgraded as drives get bigger, faster, and cheaper. Details on the upgrade process will be posted at a later date.

## Does it record audio?

No. Since it's primarily a high-speed video camera, audio processing wasn't included.
