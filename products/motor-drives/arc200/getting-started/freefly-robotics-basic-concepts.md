# Basic Concepts

The Arc200 was conceived as a universal motor drive that allows a variety of use cases.  Our priorities in designing the Arc200 were:

* Robustness
* Performance
* Ease of setup
* Ease of integration

Arc 200 features sensorless [field oriented control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control_%28motor%29) which allows for low torque ripple over the full speed range, and most importantly no 10-16khz screeching!
