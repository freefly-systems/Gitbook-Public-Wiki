### Connecting The Drive <a id="WiringArc200-ConnectingTheDrive"></a>

Always connect the motor and any wiring with the DC power disconnected! Never attach or disconnect a motor when the drive is powered up. Damage to the hardware may occur.

See the [Sample Configurations](sample-configurations/) for some diagrams showing connections to the drive for a few popular configurations you might find on a typical electric vehicle, RC car, etc.
