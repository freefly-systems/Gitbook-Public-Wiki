# FAQ

## Why does FRX Pro have longer range?

Inside FRX Pro is a completely new and more powerful radio module using 900Mhz. The combination of a more powerful transmitter and change to a different frequency allows FRX Pro to reach ranges previously impossible!

## Is FRX Pro a signal booster?

No, FRX Pro is a standalone radio transmitter and receiver. This means there is no need to keep MōVI Controller RX attached to the gimbal when using FRX Pro.

## Can I use just one FRX Pro?

FRX Pro works as a receiver and transmitter pair so two modules are needed to communicate between a Freefly gimbal and control product. Since none of Freefly's gimbal controllers use 900MHz natively, one FRX Pro module must be connected to the gimbal and another to the controller. 

## How do I bind my FRX Pro modules?

Binding FRX Pro is easy! Push the bind button on the module connected to the Freefly gimbal controller, wait one second, then push the bind button on the module connected to the gimbal. When connected both FRX Pro status lights will turn green. More information can be found [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@freefly/s/freefly-public/~/edit/drafts/-LcgaRt1etwZTccsSy3d/products/frx-pro/how-to-use/how-to-bind).

## Do FRX Pro sets need to stay together?

No, individual FRX Pro modules can be bound to any other FRX Pro modules. This means FRX Pro's do not need to remain in their original pairs.

## What frequency does FRX Pro use? 

FRX Pro uses the 900MHz ISM band. 

## What do I need on my MōVI Controller and MōVI Pro/XL/Carbon to use FRX Pro?

In order to use FRX Pro with your MōVI Pro/XL/Carbon you should be using the latest stable or beta gimbal and Controller firmware. All of the cables required to use FRX Pro are provided in the kit. There are several mounting options for FRX Pro, including the use of Pop-n-Locks, Zip-ties, Velcro, and double sided tape. More information can be found [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@freefly/s/freefly-public/~/edit/drafts/-LcgaRt1etwZTccsSy3d/products/frx-pro/how-to-use/how-to-mount).

## What do the lights on the FRX Pro mean?

Information on the FRX status light meaning is available [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@freefly/s/freefly-public/~/drafts/-LcgaRt1etwZTccsSy3d/primary/products/frx-pro/overview/system-diagram#status-light-overview).

## How do I mount the FRX Pro to my MōVI and MōVI Controller?

There are several mounting options for FRX Pro, including the use of Pop-n-Locks, Zip-ties, Velcro, and double sided tape. More information can be found [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@freefly/s/freefly-public/~/edit/drafts/-LcgaRt1etwZTccsSy3d/products/frx-pro/how-to-use/how-to-mount).

## What are my antenna options for FRX Pro?

FRX Pro can use any 900MHz antenna with an RP-SMA connection! Provided in the FRX Pro kit are two sets of antennas with different gains which can be interchanged depending on available space for the antenna and range requirements.

## Will FRX Pro work with MIMIC?

FRX Pro does not work with MIMIC at this time. However, we are planning to release a update that allows this combination to function in the future!

## Will FRX Pro work with M-Series MōVI?

At this time FRX Pro does not work with M-Series gimbals. However, we are working on a solution that allows this combination to function in the future!

## Is Dual Controller possible when using FRX Pro?

Using two sets of FRX Pro with a Freefly gimbal is currently not possible due to the large power draw of the FRX Pro modules. 

## Can I use FRX Pro with the Wired Kit?

We do not advise using the FRX Pro and the wired kit together because of the amount of power FRX Pro is able to output. If you are looking to use wired control for the any gimbal combination, continue to use the wired kit as it is sold on the [webstore](https://store.freeflysystems.com/collections/control/products/wired-control-kit).

## Can I use FRX Pro with 3rd Party gimbals?

No, FRX Pro is only compatible with Freefly gimbals.
