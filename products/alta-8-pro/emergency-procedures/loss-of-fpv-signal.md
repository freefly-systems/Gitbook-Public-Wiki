# Loss of FPV Signal



### **Loss of FPV Signal**

|  | Item | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Control Inputs | AS REQUIRED |
| 2. | Visual Contact | MAINTAIN |
| 3. | ALTA Pro | POSITION for optimal signal reception |

### **If visual contact or FPV signal is not maintained:**

|  | Item | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Mode Switch | POSITION |
| 2. | Home Switch | RETURN TO HOME |
| 3. | Throttle | AS REQUIRED |

An FPV Loss of Signal \(LOS\) can occur if the aircraft flies out of range or if it flies behind an object that interrupts the signal. Maintaining visual contact is the preferred method to re-establish control of the aircraft, either with the pilot seeing the aircraft, or by the use of a visual observer.

Yawing the aircraft can help signal reception if the body of the aircraft is blocking the line of sight between the transmitter and receiver antennas.

If FPV signal or visual contact cannot be maintained, setting the Mode switch to Position Mode and enabling Return-to-Land can be used to bring the aircraft back to signal reception range.

Always maintain direct line of sight with ALTA Pro during flight, use visual observers as operations require, and follow local regulations regarding see-and-avoid requirements.** |
