# Unexpected Flight Controller Behavior



|  | Item | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Control Inputs | NEUTRALIZE |
| 2. | Mode Switch | MANUAL |
| 3. | ALTA Pro | LAND as soon as possible |

If ALTA Pro behaves unexpectedly, neutralize controls by centering the throttle/yaw and pitch/roll sticks and observe ALTA Pro. If it is still flying in an uncommanded manner in either Altitude or Position Mode, switch to Manual Mode. In most cases, unexpected behavior is due to erroneous sensor readings, degraded GPS signal reception, or compass issues.

If the unexpected behavior occurred while in Manual mode, land as soon as possible and check ALTA Pro QGroundControl for any warnings.
