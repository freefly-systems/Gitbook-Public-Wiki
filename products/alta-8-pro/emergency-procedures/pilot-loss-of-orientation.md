# Pilot Loss of Orientation



|  | **Item** | **ACTION** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Control Inputs | NEUTRALIZE |
| **2.** | **Mode Switch** | **POSITION** |
| **3.** | **Yaw** | **NOSE AWAY** |
| **4.** | **Roll** | **VERIFY DIRECTION** |

Regaining spatial orientation as quickly as possible is most important. If the pilot loses orientation of ALTA Pro, control inputs will not give the expected result, so neutralize controls by centering the throttle/yaw and pitch/roll sticks to stabilize motion. If a good GPS signal is available, enable Position Mode so ALTA Pro will stay in one place.

Use yaw only to reorient ALTA Pro so the nose is pointed away, then use the roll control to verify the orientation of ALTA Pro.

It is best practice to wait for Position Lock prior to takeoff, even if Position Mode is not planned to be used during the flight.** |
