# Alarm Indication

**Alarm Indication \(Flashing or Solid Red Light\)**

|  | Item | **Action** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Mode Switch | MANUAL |
| **2.** | **ALTA Pro** | **LAND as soon as possible** |
| **3.** | **ALTA Pro QGroundControl** | **CHECK IN APP WARNINGS** |

Alarms are displayed if the flight controller determines there is a condition present that can adversely affect the safety of the flight. Alarms are indicated by the Status Light staying or flashing Red \(depending on the flight mode\).

Land as soon as possible when the Status Light indicate a warning, and investigate the problem while ALTA Pro is safely on the ground. It is best practice to set the mode switch to Manual when an Alarm is observed to maintain full control authority of ALTA Pro.
