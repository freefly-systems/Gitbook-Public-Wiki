Prior to start, check the surrounding area to ensure people and objects are clear of ALTA Pro and its props. Also ensure that there are no people or objects between the ALTA Pro’s takeoff location and its intended flight path.  
****

Ensure that ALTA Pro QGroundControl shows all sensors are calibrated and ready for flight.

ALTA Pro’s props can cause severe injury or death or cause damage to objects while rotating. Always ensure the area surrounding the props and ALTA Pro is clear of people or objects prior to starting the motors.** |

To start the motors, hold full low throttle and full right yaw. Ensure that all the motors are spinning. Raise RPMs slightly and move the pitch, roll, and yaw controls slightly. ALTA Pro should pitch, roll, and yaw as commanded due to isolator cartridge flex. Ensure that the ALTA Pro behaves as expected. If it does not, shut down ALTA Pro and ensure the propellers are installed in the correct orientation and radio settings are correct.

Large yaw commands can cause instability.** |

After checking flight control directions, advance the throttle directly from idle to hover throttle. Prior to takeoff, do not advance throttle stick above idle until prepared for flight as this can spool up motors undesirably. While throttling up for takeoff, do not loiter in ground effect. Once in flight, use the Mode Switch to select between Manual, Altitude, or Position Mode only after first confirming proper flight performance in Manual Mode.

Attempting to take off in Altitude or Position Modes may cause ALTA Pro to tip over.** |

Pilots should be proficient in Manual Mode flight in order to react to emergency situations as required.** |
