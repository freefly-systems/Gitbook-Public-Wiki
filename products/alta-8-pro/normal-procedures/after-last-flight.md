Fold propeller blades and install foam Prop Protectors to decrease the risk of damaging the propellers while packing ALTA Pro. Keeping ALTA Pro on the payload or landing gear easily facilitates the folding process as ALTA Pro may be turned on the Toad In The Hole adapter while folding the propellers and booms. Folding the booms in opposing pairs can help maintain balance and reduce the likelihood of tipping.

Make sure that the handle is aligned front-to-back with the battery leads facing to the right when putting ALTA Pro in the included case. Pay special attention to the external GPS, 900/868MHz Telemetry radio and  optional accessories if installed \(FPV camera and Tx\) when putting the ALTA Pro back into its case.
