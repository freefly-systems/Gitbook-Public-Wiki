To set up ALTA Pro for flight, remove it from the case, and remove the prop protectors. Stow the boom retention clips by folding them down. The clips fold in one direction and are spring-loaded to stay in open and closed detented positions.

Unfolding the booms is most easily accomplished by unfolding all opposite pairs partially, then unfold the opposite boom pairs completely. ALTA Pro can become unbalanced while unfolding booms individually, so unfolding opposite pairs reduces the possibility of tipping.

Once unfolded, push on the boom latches until they audibly click, indicating the booms are secure. There should be little to no slop in the hinge. Check that the receivers and the electrical connectors that attach to the receivers are secure.

For information on installing isolator cartridges and setting up payload mounting locations, refer to the Isolator Cartridges and Configuring GroundView or SkyView sections of this manual.
