Quickly reverting to manual mode when landing in Altitude mode will prevent ALTA Pro unwanted movements .** |

Upon landing, disarm the motors by holding minimum throttle and full left yaw. This is typically done on the left radio control stick by moving it to the bottom left corner with mode 2 controllers. Disarming can only be done while in Manual Mode. Once the motors are stopped and disarmed, the Orientations Lights will flash green, and the Status Light will slowly flash white, indicating it is safe to approach ALTA Pro.

The downwash from the propellers can disturb debris. This debris can be ingested by the propellers or motors and cause damage. After the flight, ensure there is no damage to the propeller blades and that the motors still spin freely and quietly. Take extra care when operating in areas with large amounts of debris, such as in sand, dirt, or gravel.

After flight is also a good time to check the condition of battery packs. Always refer to the battery manufacturerâ€™s recommendations for inspection and replacement intervals or requirements.
