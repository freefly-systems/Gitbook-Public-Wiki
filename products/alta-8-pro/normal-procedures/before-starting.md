Check that the payload is secure by checking that the Toad In The Hole quick release lever is pushed in and that the payload does not slip. Check that all isolator cartridges are locked in place, especially if they have been recently replaced.

The blades should be checked for damage, including nicks and scrapes. If a propeller blade has been nicked enough that it catches a fingernail, it should be replaced. Bolt tightness should be checked by rotating the blade about its length \(blade pitch up and down\). There should be no slop, and if there is, the bolt and nut should be tightened until the slope is removed. There should be no slop between the propeller hub and the motor.

Motors should spin freely, and there should be no grinding or scraping sound from the motor. The inside of the motor should be free of debris.

Always turn on the radio controller before powering ALTA Pro. Follow the battery installation guidance in the Battery Installation section of this manual for battery installation instructions.

While the Autopilot initializes, keep ALTA Pro as stable as possible. Wedging a foam prop protector between the stationary gimbal or landing gear and the frame can be used to stabilize ALTA Pro from spinning during this process.

At the end of this process, the status will begin slow flashing white, indicating ALTA Pro is ready for arming. The Orientation Lights will also begin flashing green. Verify that all motors are flashing green, indicating all ESCs initialized successfully.

Verify that there are no flight warnings by connecting to ALTA Pro via ALTA Pro QGroundControl and checking for warnings or errors. For more information, see the ALTA Pro QGroundControl section of this manual.
