# Data Logging

ALTA Pro automatically logs flight and control data when ALTA Pro is armed for flight. Data is recorded to the autopilot and are accessed through the Log Download tab in the Analyze menu of ALTA Pro QGroundControl.

Summarized flight data from an individual flight can also be viewed immediately after landing by placing a downloaded log file into [PixHawk Flight Review](https://logs.px4.io/). Full details about the review process can be found in the [Flight Reporting section](https://docs.px4.io/en/getting_started/flight_reporting.html) of the Pixhawk User Manual.

A native data analyzer is being developed and will be available on the ALTA Pro Support page.
