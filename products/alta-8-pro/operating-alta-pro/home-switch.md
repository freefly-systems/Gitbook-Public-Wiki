# Home Switch

The home switch has three positions, however only the top toggle position will turn RTL on.

### **RTL Off**

\(Bottom/Middle Toggle Position\)

This is the normal switch position and does not initiate an RTL command.

### **RTL On**

\(Top Toggle Position\)

This manually initiates the RTL function. In RTL, PX4 will command ALTA Pro to climb to the set minimum altitude and then guide the unitâ€™s position to the home point.
