# Software Release Notes

## Intro

ALTA QGroundControl is based on the public version of the [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com) and is taylored for use with ALTA X and ALTA 8 Pro. Although you should be able to use the public version, we highly recommend using the Freefly version to be fully compatible. Freefly only uses and tests the ALTA QGroundControl.

## April 2019

### v1.0.6

* ALTA QGroundControl v1.0.6 is based on Public QGroundcontrol v3.5.1 stable
* Included new parameters we added for ALTA support such as LEDs and OSD 
* Overwrote their Tuning screen with our own to include frequently used parameters. This is to make it more convenient to user compared to going to all parameters screen where parameter names are cryptic and only provides basic UI. 
* Overwrote their parameter defaults to match ALTA defaults 
* Moved a component in radio screen to make it not crop for small screens 
* Overwrote app name and version number so that app can be differentiated from the public one 
* Removed "Reset all to defaults" for UX purposes. This button ends up kicking you out of wifi and erasing all calibration values 
* Adding parameter file import/export functionality for iOS and Android
