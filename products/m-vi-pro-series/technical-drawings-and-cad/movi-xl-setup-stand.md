# MoVI XL Setup Stand

During development of MoVI XL we built a modular test stand and balancing rig. We found this stand to be very useful for building and balancing camera payloads before mounting XL to a vehicle or crane. Below you can find information and links to assist you in making your own!

You will need 3 things for this build:

**The frame** : We have built out a model of the stand on vention.io where you can either; click to buy the parts and assemble yourself or check out the bill-of-materials and cut-list so you can build your own from scratch.

**The adapter plate** : This will allow you to mount the Movi XL Quick Release to the frame. You can fabricate this yourself, or order it from a service like [Protolabs ](https://www.protolabs.com/services/cnc-machining/)or [Xometry](https://www.xometry.com/).

**The quick release** : The Movi XL Quick Release Kit can be found in the Freefly Systems Store. We recommend using [M6x20 FHCS](https://www.mcmaster.com/92125A240) \(qty6\) to attach to the Quick Release to the adapter plate.
