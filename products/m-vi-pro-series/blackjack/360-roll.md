# 360 Roll

## 360° Roll Intro

This feature guide describes how 360° Roll works in MōVI Pro v2.0 Software. For the best experience, take the time to understand both the theory and practical aspects of 360° Roll modes before you go out on a shoot.

### How to use?

Enabling it is as simple as turning on 360° Roll mode from the App, MōVI Screen, or MōVI Controller menu. However, keep in mind that these ​new behaviors​ also introduce an additional level of complexity. All features described in this guide apply with 360° Roll on.

There are many ways to use 360 °Roll and its features, depending on your crew size and roll control method. Options like Tilt and Roll Snap can be applied to the different 360° Roll methods to modify their behavior as well—continue reading for more information.

### \#protip

* If you don’t actually need to roll past ±90o for your shot, consider leaving 360° Roll off and using regular control. 360° Roll is specialty tool, but also adds a level complexity that may unnecessary if you just need to do a simple, leveled-off shot.
* MōVI Pro ecosystem currently allows roll commands from:
  * MōVI Controller
  * MIMIC
  * Wheels
  * Gamepad
  * Pilot
  * API
  * App \(planned for future\)
