## Disclaimer and Warning

Please read this disclaimer and warning carefully and review the ALTA X Aircraft Flight Manual \(AFM\) prior to flight. If you have any questions, please contact support@freeflysystems.com prior to using the ALTA X. You can review the most current version of this manual on the ALTA X Support Page. By using ALTA X, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to this disclaimer. You agree that you are solely responsible for your conduct while using ALTA X, and for any direct or indirect consequences that may result from its use. You agree to only use ALTA X for proper purposes that are in accordance with local and airspace rules and regulations.

* ALTA X is not a toy and should be operated with extreme care, as improper operation can cause damage to property, serious personal injury or death. 
* As with any multi-rotor aircraft, ALTA X is a complex and technical machine. Novice pilots should invest sufficient time on a flight simulator and seek training from an experienced pilot prior to operation. The ALTA X Aircraft Flight Manual and a flight simulator are no substitute for training with an experienced pilot, particularly when it comes to learning how to safely operate ALTA X. Novice pilots should never fly without the supervision of an experienced pilot. 
* Always check ALTA X and its components prior to operation. 
* Always maintain a safe distance from ALTA X when in use. 
* Never attempt to touch ALTA X when the propellers are moving. 
* Never fly ALTA X over or around people, power lines or other aircraft. 
* Never fly with any propellers that have visible imperfections or damage. 
* Always keep children and animals a safe distance away from ALTA X when in use and when changing configurations. 
* Only use propellers supplied by Freefly Systems that are designed for use on ALTA X. 
* Always remove the propellers or power ALTA X using a low power source when making a change to the configuration of ALTA X to prevent propeller strikes in the event of unintentional motor starts. 
* Always remove the configuration jumper when making changes to the configuration of ALTA X. 
* Always test ALTA X with the propellers removed to make sure that the motors are spinning in the correct direction and that the motor assignment is correct with respect to the Autopilot flight controller. If you have either of these wrong, the ALTA X will be uncontrollable and dangerous.
* It is your responsibility to perform a full system check of ALTA X prior to every flight. 
* It is your responsibility to learn how to safely operate ALTA X and to adhere to all applicable rules and regulations. 
* Fly at your own risk. 
* ALTA X is a tuned system with custom components selected for each application. Modification, removal, or substitution of ALTA X components will void the warranty and can lead to unsafe operating conditions.
