### Maximum Gross Weight

To determine maximum gross weight, determine flight location pressure altitude and temperature, and refer to the weight in the chart below. Gross Weight includes payload, battery and structure weight.

The maximum gross weight might exceed the weight allowed by regulatory agencies. When determining gross weight, please consider any such local restrictions on aircraft weight when planning aircraft weight.

{% hint style="info" %}
The maximum gross weight at a defined density altitude was established by calculating weight so that sufficient thrust margin for maneuvering is maintained.
