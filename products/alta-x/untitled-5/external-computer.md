| 1. | To mount an external computer, first open the chassis.  Directions for opening the chassis can be found in the maintenance section. |  |
| 2. | Once the chassis is open use the 32x32 mm hole pattern in the lower chassis plate  to mount the computer.  The hole pattern is sized for M3 bolts.  | ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GM4WWcYwP87bxoz6QxyzHwP1K6eJiqNFBJKgU0282UP7EiRpzEZ53pJZbi-Md2g9vjTVjYH5_mQLJbpalbMGbl2JA-U082ykDBcW_rSWKZVcAc3_i6eWuE8vyj9SfXO0uktEBrRy) |
| 3. | After mounting the external computer and routing its power and I/O cables, close the chassis. |  |

## Power & Comms

Power is available from a few sources:

* 5V from expansion ports \(see Expansion Ports section\)
* 5V or 12V DC-DC converters

Communication to the aircraft is currently available through the Mavlink on the expansion port labelled "UART" \(see expansion ports sections\)
