# MoVI Carbon

MoVI Carbon makes a perfect companion to the ALTA X. When installing Carbon onto an ALTA, please note the following:

* To use MōVI Carbon with ALTA X, we recommend using the 40 duro isolators that ship with ALTA X.
* Install landing gear on MōVI Carbon and attach to ALTA X using the Toad in the Hole Quick Release. 
* We recommend using qty 2 12s 16Ah flight packs with MōVI Carbon as this will allow 20+ minute flight times.
* The default Movi Carbon tuning should work well with ALTA X.
* FRX Pro can be added to MoVI Carbon to increase control range and robustness.
