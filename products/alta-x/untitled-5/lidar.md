Freefly has tested the [Phoenix LiDAR](https://www.phoenixlidar.com/miniranger/) systems to ensure easy integration and compatibility.  To use ALTA X with the the miniRANGER system simply install the system using the Toad in the Hole quick release, and then follow the normal LiDAR workflow as described by [Phoenix Aerial](https://phoenixlidar.gitbook.io/documentation/).
