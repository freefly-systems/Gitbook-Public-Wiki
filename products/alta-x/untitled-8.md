### Additional Required Components

#### Radio Controller

ALTA X supports a variety of radio controllers as outlined in the Controller Integration section of the manual. A minimum of five \(5\) channels are required, with four \(4\) used for flight control, and the remaining one \(1\) used for mode selection. A  radio controller with between six to ten channels is highly recommended to make use of Return-to-Land \(RTH\) and ALTA Xâ€™s other functions. It is recommended to use a radio controller with a three-way switch for Mode selection and a two-way switch for the [Return-to-Launch](untitled-7.md#return-to-launch) function.

#### Flight Battery

ALTA X can accommodate a variety of Lithium Polymer \(LiPo\) flight battery packs. Battery packs must be 12S, having a nominal voltage of 44.4 V. Only run ALTA X using two packs at a time. For additional information on expected flight duration, refer to the [Performance Section](../alta-8-pro/performance/weight-endurance-performance-data.md) of this manual.
