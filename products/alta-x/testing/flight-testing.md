# Flight Testing

Before the launch of Alta X the Freefly team completed over 500 hours of flight and simulated flight testing.  The summary and details for these flights can be [found here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U8e_XQAABZtwCcu1WQMT0Hj9cCPUEaBiS4saH9bgJpM).

For these test the team at Freefly pushed the Alta X harder than we think a customer would ever imagine.  This meant stressing the machine to the limit in order to ensure robust performance in the field.  

Freefly also leveraged a small group of external beta testers during this phase to ensure they were pleased with the Alta X performance.  We did have a difficult time getting the test machines back from several of these testers \(Ahem Pat Weir\) ðŸ˜‚
