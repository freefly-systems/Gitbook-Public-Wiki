| **Worlds Toughest Drone** | **Flight Time** |
| Introducing the world's toughest drone: ALTA X. We’re confident in ALTA X because we push it to the limit, and then well past - over and over again so that we know our customers will have plenty of margin in the unpredictable real world. | An effort to make ALTA X as light as possible allows ALTA X to fly MōVI Carbon \(20lb payload\) for 25 minutes, or a max payload for 8 minutes. Smaller payload flight times can exceed 40 minutes |
| **Payload** | **ActiveBlade** |
| ALTA X can carry up to a 35lb payload while maintaining a 2:1 thrust to weight ratio. | Four ActiveBlades reduce the motor vibrations to 1/5th the normal level. This innovative solution to reduce vibrations increases the lifetime of ALTA X and helps keep any payload stable. |
| **Speed** | **Easy Deployment** |
| Never worry about keeping up with the action again, ALTA X has a top speed of over 60mph \(95km/h\), just make sure that the action can keep up with ALTA X! | No assembly required! Using a clever rotating planar linkage ALTA X folds and unfolds with ease! This revolutionary feature allows ALTA X to go from case to flight within minutes, reducing setup time and minimizing the risk of misassembly on the job. |
| **Packability** | **Flight Modes** |
| ALTA X folds to 30% of its full size to fit in the same case as ALTA 8 while still being able to carry 175% ALTA 8’s payload. This case is TSA approved and has been tested to ensure ALTA X arrives to location ready to go! | High quality sensors and GPS modules allow ALTA X to maintain its position and height even in the most unfavorable weather conditions providing assurances during autonomous waypoint missions and piloted flights. |
| **External Power** | **Expandability** |
| Five user accessible power expansions allow ALTA X to power any accessories or payloads you need to do the job.  | Designed with the future in mind, ALTA X is modular and easily expandable to adapt to ever changing technology. This expandability ensures that ALTA X will continue to be state-of-the-art even after years of service. |
| **Easy Integration** | **External Computer** |
| ALTA X is designed to be a platform that can be customized for any aerial need; from cinema, to forestry, and bridge inspection, ALTA X is a versatile tool ready for any challenge.  | Some drone applications require real time onboard computing; ALTA X has the necessary mounts, power, and I/O so it can be upgraded with an external computer. |
| **User repairable**  | **Customer Service** |
| In order to keep ALTA X in the field as much as possible all ALTA X parts can be bought as spares and replaced onsite. Of course we will still offer factory checkups and repair services should they be needed! | Like all Freefly products, ALTA X is backed by a team of experts ready to answer any questions and make sure you get the job done. |
