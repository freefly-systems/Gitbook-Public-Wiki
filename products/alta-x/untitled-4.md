# Maintenance

## Interval Inspections

### Every 15 Flights

ALTA X is designed to be as low-maintenance as possible. It is recommended to check ALTA X’s fasteners regularly. This check should occur roughly after every 15 flights. To check ALTA X’s fasteners, apply a tightening torque to each fastener on the chassis using the supplied hex drivers. The fasteners should not slip.

#### Inspect Fastener Tightness

Check the tightness of the following fasteners to verify no loose fasteners:

* Motor mount bolts
* Boom clamping bolts
* Prop hub bolts
* Prop bolts
* Top and bottom chassis bolts
* Closeout panel bolts
* FPV camera mounting plate bolts
* Boom stay attachment bolts
* GPS/Compass mounting bolts

{% hint style="info" %}
If a fastener does slip, tighten it using the methods described in the Fastener Installation section. Do not apply additional thread locking compound unless the fastener has repeatedly come loose.
{% endhint %}

### Every 15 Flight Hours

#### Inspect Fastener Tightness

Check the tightness of the fasteners as described above.

#### Inspection Wear Components

Inspect the following items. Replace if worn.

* Propeller blades - Chips, cracks, or deep scratches
* ActiveBlade bumpers   - Broken or crushed

#### Inspect Boom Ring Latch Tightness

Check boom latching tightness by closing the latch. There should be a firm closing force and click. Adjust the tension by using a 2.0mm hex wrench on the set screw located in the rear of the latch link.

## Replacement of Parts

Spare or replacement parts are available for sale separately at [freeflysystems.com](https://freeflysystems.com/). Please refer to the store for a current listing of all available spare parts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Use Of Threadlocker**

Bolts and screws used in the daily use of this aircraft do not require threadlocking compound. This includes the screws holding on the battery trays, vibration isolation system and the Skyview landing gear parts. 

However, for the structural fasteners described in parts of this section blue Loctite 243 compound or equivalent is required. Apply sparingly to the threads before insertion.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Fastener Installation**

The Freefly hex drivers included with ALTA X are designed to limit the torque that can be applied to each bolt or screw and help prevent stripping the fastener head.

Thread all fasteners into their respective holes until snug \(when the fastener head bottoms out and lightly clamps the two mating parts together\).

To prevent excessive tightening and damaging the fastener or parts, twist the driver from the smaller diameter knurled section of the tool between your thumb and index finger for small fasteners \(under size M3\) or with your thumb and two forefingers for larger fasteners \(size M3 and larger\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before performing any part replacement, ensure that ATLA X has been unplugged from any power source. Leaving ALTA X powered while performing any work on it can result in a potentially dangerous situation.
{% endhint %}

### Replacing Booms

{% hint style="info" %}
If replacing more than one boom, replace one at a time to reduce the chances of mixing up connections.
{% endhint %}

|  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Remove the top chassis as detailed in the previous section. |  |
| 2. | Trace the wires from the boom to be replaced. There will be three cables from each boom, a power cable, an LED cable and a motor control cable. Carefully unplug each, taking care to note the locations for when the replacement boom is fitted.  |  |
| 3. | Remove any strain relieving zip ties. Take care to note the correct wire routing. |  |
| 4. | Loosen the three M4 bolts that clamp the boom, and carefully slide the boom out of the hinge. |  |
| 5. | Remove the corrugated tube from the old boom, noting its location on the harness. If being reused, remove the ActiveBlade assembly from the old boom. |  |
| 6. | Prepare the new boom assembly by attaching the corrugated tube. |  |
| 7. | Feed the wiring harness through the hinge, slide the boom into place and temporarily secure by lightly tightening the hinge bolts. |  |
| 8. | Connect new boom’s three cables, route the wires and secure with strain relief zip ties where needed. Make sure the corrugated tube is positioned correctly and strain relieved to the chassis securely. |  |
| 9. | Replace the enclosure cover and reinstall the top chassis per the previous section. |  |
| 10. | The booms on ALTA X are clocked to improve yaw authority. Replacement booms are supplied with alignment cards to allow accurate clocking of the motors. Their use is covered in this video. Before aligning the motors, completely remove the M4 boom clamp fasteners, and apply Loctitie 243 or equivalent. Once aligned, torque fasteners. |  |
| 11. | Reattach the ActiveBlade assembly as described in previous section. |  |

### Updating Firmware

Autopilot and system component firmware is updated via the USB expansion port on ALTA X located in the chassis closeout between booms 1 and 2. To update firmware download the latest [FW files from the ALTA X Firmware page](https://freeflysystems.com/support/alta-x-support) and follow the instructions below.
